# Introduction

This document will show the comparison of Machine Learning algorithms where the results are shown so that they can be distinguished from each other, for that they will be tabulated for a better expression of them, therefore we can choose the most favorable result for this, aspects such as its speed and precision will be taken, for this we will use a DATASET called "BANK MARKETING DATA SET"

There they can provide us with the DATASET downloads and the Data Set Description to be able to extract the values that need to be extracted later. Having said that, we will start with the established points shown in the index on page 2 of this documentation.


# Theoretical framework of the algorithms

1.	SVM

Support Vector Machine ”(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for ranking or regression challenges. However, it is mainly used in classification problems.

In the SVM algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is the number of entities it has) with the value of each entity as the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we performed the classification by finding the hyperplane that differentiated the two classes very well.

2.	Decision Three 

A tree has many analogies in real life, and it turns out that it has influenced a wide area of machine learning, covering both classification and regression. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. As its name suggests, it uses a tree-shaped decision model. Although it is a commonly used tool in data mining to derive a strategy to achieve a particular goal, it is also widely used in machine learning, which will be the main focus of this article.

A decision tree is drawn upside down with its root at the top. In the image on the left, the bold text in black represents an internal condition / node, based on which the tree is divided into branches / edges. The end of the branch that is no longer divided is the decision / sheet, in this case, whether the passenger died or survived, represented as red and green text respectively

3. Logistic Regression 

Logistic regression is a predictive modeling algorithm that is used when variable Y is binary categorical. That is, it can only take two values such as 1 or 0. The objective is to determine a mathematical equation that can be used to predict the probability of event 1. Once the equation is established, it can be used to predict the Y when only Las X are known.

4. Multilayer Perceptron

The following article provides a summary of the Perceptron Learning Algorithm. What does the word Perceptron mean in the machine learning industry? Perceptron is an artificial neural network unit that performs calculations to better understand data. What is a neural network unit? A group of artificial neurons interconnected to each other through synaptic connections is known as a neural network.

What is an artificial neuron?

Considering the state of the world today and to solve the problems around us, we are trying to determine the solutions by understanding how nature works, this is also known as biomimetics. Similarly, to function as human brains, people develop artificial neurons that function similarly to biological neurons in a human. An artificial neuron is a complex mathematical function, which takes data and weights separately, fuses them, and passes them through the mathematical function to produce results.
